Hash Tables have O(1) time complexity.
provides data lookup by key and behaves like a dictionary, you can refference a value by its key ( or index ).
There can be collisions if there are two values combined to the same Key.
You can avoid collisions by using open addressing or linked list chaining.
Linked list chaining traverses through the table to see if there is a taken key.
