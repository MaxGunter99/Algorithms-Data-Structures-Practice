---=== Queues ===---

Queues use First-in First-out ( FIFO ) ordering.
Like a line, the one who ordered food first will be the one to get their food first.

Operations:

    1. append( x ) - Adds x to the end of the list
    2. remove() - Removes the first item from the list ( Shift() in javascript )
    3. peek() - Returns the top of the Queues
    4. isEmpty() - If true if the queue is isEmpty
